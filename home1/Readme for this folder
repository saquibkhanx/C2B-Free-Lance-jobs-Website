This is just a backup folder for the Home.html.
Originally, I had kept all of the files inside seperate folders just to make it look neat. But then I realized it took a few more steps to run the code so I changed the href from ../home/home to just /home.
This was just for convenience sake and just to make the project more accessable. I kept the original files for home just as a momento since it was the first actual html and css code I have written for a project xD.
