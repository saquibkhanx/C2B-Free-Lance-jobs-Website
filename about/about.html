<h3><b>PROJECT INFO? </b> </h3>
<p>
Hey, I am MD. Saquib Khan from k1 from the BCA Batch of Techno India,Salt-Lake. I was given the task of making an E-Commerce C2B website as my minor project for in my final year. I have named this project and this website as Workshare as I am driven by the idea that sharing makes even the toughest work easier


<h3> <b>WHY Workshare ? </b> </h3>
<p>
I’ve designed an interactable E-Commerce website using HTML and CSS. The challenge of this project was that I was allowed limited usage of javascript for building this project as it is solely an HTML based project. 
This website is designed to help you find not only the best quality candidates, but more of them. To streamline the process so you can save time and money. And to help you make smarter decisions to improve your return on investment.

Basically, gives you the ability to hire like no one else can.
