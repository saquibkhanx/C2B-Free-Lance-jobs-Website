# C2B-Free-Lance-jobs-Website

This is a website I made during my university project using HTML and CSS. 
You might notice I have barely used javascript, that is because one of the challenges for making this project was limited usaged of js.
As such, this project is purely made using HTML and CSS. Obviously not purely but yeah there are a few random stuff here and there lul
Also, to run the code, just run Home.html. All of the codes are interconnected using href so you can access all pages by opening any page.
Thank you!
